In Weld CDI for bean init during bootstrap you can use the following

And however you can load application config beans from .properties and .yml files.

With ApacheDeltaSpike you can inject fields in SpingApp style (@Value).

You can run different configuration of JavaFx application, and run one

JavaFx app (for example "Admin user UI") from another JavaFx app ("Regular user UI")
